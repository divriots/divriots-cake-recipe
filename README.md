## What you need

Cooking stuff

```txt
1 Tablespoon
1 Mixing bowl
1 Whisk
1 Printer
```

190g softened butter
75g Icing sugar
1 tsp of salt
1 tsp of cinnamon
1 egg white
225g Flour
```

Vegaized Ingredient Swaps

```txt
190g softened butter => 190g vegan butter / spread (that on was easy and some may say obvious)
1 egg white => Here you have options (any of these, results may vary).

   Chia Seed Egg - 1 tbsp chia seeds + 2.5 tbsp water
   Flax Seed Egg - 1 tbsp flax seed (ground, raw) + 2.5 tbsp water
   For both of these mix the seeds with the water, mix / tiny whisk and leave for around 5 mins to thicken a little.

   Applesauce (mashed) / Mashed ripe banana - around 3 or 4 tbsp of either.

   Egg replacer - Store bought replacer (Oggs is good for those in the UK)

Method and timings are as standard ingredients. So now the whole team can chomp on the sugary goodness.

## How to hack it together

1. Scrape the vanilla pod using¬†a paring knife to slice the¬†pod in half (we should have told you about the knife in our list of kitchen stuff, sorry about that, we hope you have one around) once the pod opens, use the back of the said knife to scrape the seed away from the pod. We will be using the seeds, not the pod. Although you can re-use the pod for other things, we will stay focused on our fancy recipe for now.

2. Work the butter, icing sugar, vanilla and salt in a mixing bowl. You might wonder how butter is worked, well, it's a fancy word to say that you mix it with the rest of the ingredients (subtle hint coming from the "mixing" bowl).

3. Add the egg white until fully blended. If you are asking yourself how to separate an egg white, well, a million people shared your thought according to the views of the well named [How To Separate Egg Whites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-OwbEy-Vxk)

4. Add the flour and blend.

5. Preheat your oven at 350¬∞F (that's 170¬∞C for Europeans).

6. Now the tricky part: print our awesome cake-blueprint (told you you needed a printer) and lay on a previously buttered plate the dough with a piping bag, somehow following the blueprint, in a perfect ‚Äπdiv‚Ä∫RIOTS shape.

   ‚ò£Ô∏è¬†Don't lay the dough directly on the blueprint though, the paper could catch fire in the oven and burn your house down, that or your cake would taste funny, anyhow: don't.

7. Bake for 20 minutes, cross fingers ü§û
